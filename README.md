# NetTest
Simple powershell script that will continuously test the internet-connection.

Will ping "www.google.com" to check if the connection is up.
If it is not up it'll print "NO INTERNET"
Once the internet reutrn it'll print "Internet is back" as well as using TTS to give an audible respons, it'll then breake the loop and end the program.
